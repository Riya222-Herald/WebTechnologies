        <img src="hayday.jpg" width="1200px" height="600px">
        <p>Hay Day is a freemium mobile farming game developed and published by Supercell. Hay Day was released for iOS on 21 June 2012 and Android on 
           20 November 2013. According to a 2013 report, Supercell earned $30 million a month from Hay Day and Clash of Clans.In 2013, Hay 
           Day was the fourth highest game in revenue generated.So the gameplay is that The player's uncle is unable to take care of his farm anymore,
           so he hands over the responsibility of caring for the farm to the player. The game starts with a scarecrow giving the player a farming 
           tutorial. By selling crops/products, the player earns coins which can be used to buy production buildings, pets and decoration items. By 
           doing so, they also earn experience points (XP), with which they level up. As they progress, the player is eventually introduced to Angus,
           a friend of the player's uncle who gives a fishing tutorial. Earlier on, the player is also introduced to an NPC named Greg, who arrives at
           the player's farm requesting items, or puts items in his "roadside shop" which players can buy.Players form into small "neighborhoods", in 
           which the members can assist each other when in need (for example, by requesting multiple items) and can also chat with one another. Players
            can also trade their goods with the other friends or neighbors from the neighbourhood.
